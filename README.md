# <center> Time Machine / Tic Tac Toe </center>


## What is about?

#### The project is about two games. Time Machine is a game that saves the clicks that a user made in a matrix in order to show the trip that the user made at the end. Tic Tac Toe is the common x and cero game, but this one has some special functionalities, for example the preview one that basically shows a reprise of the game.
